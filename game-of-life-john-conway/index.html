    	<h1>The Game of life</h1>
    	<p>
	    	The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. 
	    	<b>It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.</b>
	    </p>
    	<h2>The Rules</h2>
    	<h5 style="color: red">NOTE: black box represents unpopulated cell, white for a populated cell </h5>
   		<p>For a space that is 'populated':</p>
	    <ul>
			<li>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</li>
			<li>Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
			<li>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p>For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The initial pattern in the game is called a seed. The rules above are applied to every single cell in the seed simultanously. Births and deaths occur simultaneously. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations
